# Oidn-Recipes

Project Description

This project is just a basic HTMl recipe page with 
a few links to different recipes. I've already built 
a few very basic webpages with HTML and CSS before, so this 
should be no problem at all! I am however using the 
linux command terminal for the first time for making 
dirs and files, which will slow me down a bit. Catching
 on quick.
